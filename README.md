**nes** adds native WebSocket support to [**hapi**](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi)-based application
servers. Instead of treating the WebSocket connections as a separate platform with its own security
and application context, **nes** builds on top of the existing **hapi** architecture to provide a
flexible and organic extension.
